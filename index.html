<p><b>Big Ben</b> - знаменитая часовая башня, часть Дворца Вестминстера в Лондоне.</p>

<h2>History of creation</h2>

<p>The idea of creating a clock tower for the new parliament building (the old one, built in the 11th century, almost completely burned down in 1834) was proposed by architect Charles Barry. However, Big Ben was designed by another architect, Augustus Pugin. He was born into the family of a French draftsman and, as a teenager, designed medieval-style furniture for Windsor Castle. It was thanks to Pugin that Big Ben acquired its famous look.</p>

<table style="margin:1em; float:right; width:220px; border:1px solid #aaa; background:#f9f9f9;">
    <tr>
        <td><img style="width: 26rem; height: 24rem;" src="https://motivated-card-12d34c19bf.media.strapiapp.com/Augustus_Welby_Northmore_Pugin_ebb9eacbb2.jpg" alt="Augustus Pugin"></td>

    <tr>
        <td style="text-align:center; font-size:0.9em; padding:0.3em;">Augustus Pugin</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>The construction of the tower lasted for 16 years, from 1843 to 1859. Alas, Pugin did not manage to see his creation, which eventually became one of the main attractions of England: he died in 1852.</p>

<h2>Features of the structure and interesting facts</h2>

<p>Big Ben is a 96-meter brick structure, lined with limestone and granite, and with a complex roof covered with 3,400 cast-iron "scales".</p>

<p>The construction of the tower took place from the inside - the Londoners did not see any scaffolding, as they were located in the inner part of the building.</p>

<p>The materials were imported from various regions of the kingdom - the West Midlands, Yorkshire, Cornwall, and the technical innovations of that time were used at the construction site: concrete mixers and steam-powered winches.</p>

<p>For more than a century and a half, Big Ben was officially called the clock tower of the Palace of Westminster. However, in 2012, the year of Elizabeth II's 60th anniversary on the throne, it was renamed in honor of the Queen.</p>

<p>The creation of the watch was entrusted not to an engineer, but to a lawyer and an amateur watchmaker, Edmund Beckett-Denison. he developed a pendulum that could withstand the effects of climatic factors.</p>

<p>The light from the device (Ayrton's lantern) can be seen from anywhere in the British capital, but initially the beam was directed towards Buckingham Palace. Queen Victoria, therefore, knew that the House of Commons was in session after dark.</p>

<p>There were some famous people in the prison cell. Among them was Emmeline Pankhurst, the leader of the British women's rights movement.</p>

<p>The total weight of the mechanism is 5 tons. The diameter of each dial is 7 meters, the length of the hour hands is 2.7 meters, and the minute hands are 4.2 meters.</p>

<p>There are five bells in total. The big one, Big Ben, rings every hour, and the four small ones, nameless ones, ring every 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Above the bells is a platform with a huge lighting device (Ayrton's lantern), installed here in 1885 and named after politician Acton S. Ayrton. it lights up during the evening sessions of Parliament.</p>

<p>In order to get to the playground with a lantern, the tower caretaker needs to overcome almost 400 steps.</p>

<p>There is a prison cell inside the tower, to which emotionally unrestrained parliamentarians were once sent.</p>

<h2>How to get to Big Ben</h2>

<p>The famous tower is a minute's walk from Westminster Underground station. You can get here on three lines of the London underground at once</p>

<p>Big Ben, of course, can also be reached by the famous doubledeckers - red double-decker buses. you need to get off at the westminster bus stop.</p>
